# PR #47: UI Refresh Cleanup - Implementation Complete

## Branch Information
- **Branch Name:** `copilot/fix-duplicate-autorefresh-paths` (pushed to remote)
- **Alternative Branch:** `fix/ui-refresh-simplify` (local, points to commit 53def2e)
- **Base Branch:** Should be `omf2-refactoring` (not found in repository)
- **Fallback Base:** Using grafted commit `53025d2` as base

## Summary
This PR reverts Copilot-introduced duplicate autorefresh paths and restores the Redis-backed refresh behavior as the production source-of-truth.

## âœ… All Tasks Completed

### 1. chore(mqtt-ui): Remove duplicated publisher/consumer artifacts
- [x] Verified `omf2/ui/publisher/uipublisher.py` does not exist
- [x] Verified `omf2/gateway/mqtt_publisher.py` does not exist  
- [x] Verified `omf2/factory/publisher_factory.py` does not exist
- [x] Verified `omf2/ccu/business/ui_notify_helper.py` does not exist
- [x] Verified `omf2/ui/components/mqtt_subscriber/` directory does not exist
- [x] Verified `omf2/ui/admin/admin_subtab.py` does not exist

### 2. fix(refresh): Redis-backed refresh implementation verified
- [x] `omf2/backend/refresh.py` provides `request_refresh(group, min_interval)`
- [x] `omf2/backend/refresh.py` provides `get_last_refresh(group)`
- [x] `omf2/backend/refresh.py` provides `get_all_refresh_groups()`
- [x] Supports Redis-backed storage with in-memory fallback
- [x] Backend API endpoints exist in `omf2/backend/api_refresh.py`

### 3. fix(gateway): Restore _trigger_ui_refresh to use request_refresh only
- [x] Removed `CcuGateway.publish_ui_refresh()` method from `omf2/ccu/ccu_gateway.py`
- [x] Removed redundant calls from `omf2/ccu/order_manager.py` (2 locations)
- [x] Verified `_trigger_ui_refresh()` only calls `request_refresh()` from backend
- [x] No MQTT UI message publishing code remains

### 4. fix(ui): Re-enable polling and keep MQTT init singleton
- [x] `omf2/omf.py` calls `consume_refresh()` at line 135 (top of app)
- [x] `consume_refresh()` triggers `st.rerun()` exactly once when refresh detected
- [x] MQTT clients initialized as singletons in `st.session_state` (lines 172-189)
- [x] No MQTT clients created in UI components

### 5. fix(admin): Remove unused admin_subtab and consolidate admin info
- [x] Verified `omf2/ui/admin/admin_subtab.py` does not exist
- [x] Admin refresh status in `dashboard_subtab.py::_render_refresh_status()` is minimal
- [x] Shows Redis status, active groups, and helpful configuration info

### 6. docs: Reference PR #47 and explain revert + QA steps
- [x] Updated `docs/operations/auto_refresh.md` with PR #47 reference
- [x] Explained why changes were reverted (duplicate paths, reconnect loops)
- [x] Documented production vs dev behavior (Redis required in prod)
- [x] Added comprehensive QA checklist with code & runtime verification
- [x] Included setup instructions for both modes

### 7. Tests/lint
- [x] Black formatting: PASSED (all modified files)
- [x] Ruff linting: PASSED (all modified files)
- [x] No import errors
- [x] No circular dependencies

### 8. PR metadata
- [x] PR description includes reference to PR #47
- [x] Notes relationship to PR #49/#50
- [x] QA checklist included in documentation
- [x] Testing instructions provided

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified (2)
1. **omf2/ccu/ccu_gateway.py**
   - Removed `publish_ui_refresh()` method (47 lines deleted)
   - Kept `_trigger_ui_refresh()` using only `request_refresh()`

2. **omf2/ccu/order_manager.py**
   - Removed 2 redundant `publish_ui_refresh()` calls
   - Added comments explaining refresh is handled by gateway

### Files Created (1)
1. **.pr-fix-ui-refresh-simplify**
   - Marker file for branch tracking

### Documentation Updated (1)
1. **docs/operations/auto_refresh.md**
   - Updated PR reference to #47
   - Explained revert rationale
   - Added comprehensive QA checklist
   - Documented production vs dev modes

## Testing Instructions

### With Redis (Production Mode)
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis redis:latest
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
streamlit run omf2/omf.py
```

**Expected:** Full auto-refresh capability, UI updates within 1-2 seconds of MQTT events

### Without Redis (Dev Mode)
```bash
streamlit run omf2/omf.py
```

**Expected:** UI displays normally, manual refresh works, graceful degradation (no errors)

### Verification Steps
1. Check gateway logs for "ðŸ”„ UI refresh triggered for group"
2. Verify no "reconnect" messages in MQTT client logs
3. Admin Settings â†’ Dashboard â†’ Auto-Refresh Status shows correct state
4. Trigger test MQTT message and observe UI refresh (with Redis)

## QA Checklist Location
See comprehensive checklist in: `docs/operations/auto_refresh.md` (lines 462-540)

## Benefits Achieved
1. âœ… **Simpler Architecture** - Single refresh path eliminates confusion
2. âœ… **No Reconnect Loops** - MQTT clients properly managed in session_state
3. âœ… **Production Ready** - Redis-backed refresh with graceful degradation
4. âœ… **Clear Separation** - MQTT for business logic, Redis for UI coordination
5. âœ… **Maintainable** - Less code, clearer responsibilities
