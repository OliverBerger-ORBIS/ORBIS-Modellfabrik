# futurefactory

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Due to limitations while building the libary, we must copy the toplevel `common` directory to be inside the `src` directory.  
This is automatically done after install and before build via the `postinstall` and `prebuild` steps in the `package.json` file.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project futurefactory` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project futurefactory`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project futurefactory` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build futurefactory` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build futurefactory`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/futurefactory` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test futurefactory` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
